# Introduction

To align with the new trend of generative AI models we created What'sCooking which is an application where users can easily extract their shopping basket items with a click. These items undergo analysis by advanced AI, which then suggests personalized recipes based on the user's inventory. The AI filters the ingredients to ensure the suggestions align with the user's preferences.

The purpose is to test the usage of AI that generates new human-readable content rather than finding or classifying existing content. This falls under the category of LLMs. More explanations about this will be provided in upcoming sections. Furthermore, the purpose of Prompt Engineering and how it can make a big difference when tweaking communication with a large chat model will be discussed.

The application doesn't stop at recommendations; it dynamically generates images of suggested recipes. Users can also personalize their experience on the Preferences page, specifying dietary restrictions and culinary preferences. Powered by LLM, generative AI, and AWS for deployment, the app is at the forefront of innovation. Continuous updates ensure optimization of pricing, performance benchmarking, and accommodation of diverse user requests.
