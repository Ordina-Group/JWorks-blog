Our journey began with eight colleagues, including myself, as we embarked on a trip from Brussels to Barcelona by plane. The excitement was noticeable, especially since we were leaving behind the gloomy Belgian weather for the sunny and vibrant atmosphere of Spain.

On Thursday morning, we woke up eager to attend the conference. With our registration tickets in hand, we headed to the venue and were warmly greeted by the volunteers at the registration desk. From that point, the conference truly began.

We want to thank [Sergi Almar](https://x.com/sergialmar) and his team for their excellent organization.
