# Introduction

This year the cloud-native conference is hosted in the capital of love: Paris, France. 
The convention center, Expo Port de Versailles, is a huge complex. 
Funnily enough, it's so big that there are other (non-kubecon | cloudnativecon) events going on at the same time as Kubecon in the conference center. 
Pavilion 7 where the conference is hosted, is a very nice building which looks very recent. 
The biggest difference with the previous conferences we attended (Valencia and Amsterdam) is that everything is very close to each other. 
The building has 3 floors: the main entrance, the showcase floor and the talk-rooms-floor. 
All talks are held in rooms that are oriented in a large square, with the keynote room being in the middle. 
This makes it very easy to quickly switch between rooms, especially compared to the 5-10 minute walks we were used to in Valencia and Amsterdam.

# Highlighted talks

## Atlantis and OpenTofu

Atlantis is an automation solution that assists teams in managing their Infrastructure as Code rollouts by integrating the automation process into their Source Control Management system (E.g. GitHub).
It can run plans on code branches and provide the plan output in the pull request associated with the branch. 
When a user wants to apply the changes (the plan is approved), Atlantis can roll out the required changes directly. 
The biggest selling point for this is that the user never has to leave the SCM to manage rollout out changes.

The core maintainers of Atlantis shared the history of the project and how they became owners of the project. 
They shared what their journey looked like and provided an insight into what the future holds for Atlantis. 

Today, Atlantis doesn't natively support OpenTofu as a first-class citizen yet, but efforts are ongoing to change this (Epic link: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/3741). 
Since Atlantis supports custom workflows, there is a way to use OpenTofu already today with Atlantis. 

If you're running Terraform or OpenTofu setups at scale, this is surely a project to check out. 
One of the few downsides is that Atlantis expects to receive webhooks from your SCM. 
This requires Atlantis to be exposed on the public internet if you're using a SaaS-based SCM. 
There are workarounds: 
- limit the IPs that can access the endpoint to those linked to your SCM
- Put a reverse proxy in front of Atlantis and heavily filter the traffic
- (our favorite) use natively integrated CI solutions like AWS CodePipeline and "fake" the webhook from there

## Startup lessons from 25 years and 5 startups & Panel: Venture Captial and Open Source

These were two talks in the StartupFest co-located event of Kelsey Hightower.
The first talk discussed six useful lessons for doing a startup. 
Tim Enwall from Fermyon shared his experiences and gave startup owners key things to consider when managing their startups. 
One of the takeaways that was mentioned multiple times during other talks as well was: don't be afraid of giving away one or two percent more of shares when discussing Venture Capital.
The key reason is that the percentages don't make a difference in case the startup fails, 1 or 2 percent of 0 is still 0. 
On the other hand, if the startup does very well, you're at the point where it does not significantly affect your outcome either because you'll be earning tons of money anyway. 

Another interesting lesson Tim shared was that VCs are a necessary evil. 
I'm not sure if this was planned or not, but the talk directly afterward was a panel with VCs. 
The VCs shared how to evaluate potential investments are provided suggestions on how a startup can make itself more interesting to a VC. 
The two takeaways here were: the best way to some product-market-fit is by having paying customers using your solution and secondly, show the VC data that backs any claims you're making w.r.t. customer adoption and market interest in your product. 

## [Kubernetes Maintainers Read Mean Comments - Tim Hockin (Google) & Davanum Srinivas (AWS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNRnB4rGZBI){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Being an open-source developer can be a very satisfying and rewarding job.
Engaging with a large community, particularly with famous open-source software, often leads to heartwarming feedback from dedicated users.
Open-source is more than just the open development of a product. 
It has a widespread community, people contribute by either reporting issues on the issue tracker, by submitting a pull request to improve the software, participating in discussions on Slack or public forums, attending public meetings, ... .
Sadly, it can also be a thankless job and not all people realize that open source software is something that anyone can contribute to, and does not really have any limitations as to how someone can contribute to.

Tim Hockin (Google) and Davanum Srinivas (AWS) both maintain the Kubernetes project on Github.
In this talk, they show some of the meanest, weirdest, most ridiculous comments written by Kubernetes users on public forums such as Reddit and the Github issue tracker. 
Most comments are about frustrations why it takes too long for a certain feature to be implemented or for a certain bug to be fixed.
While some of them are hilarious, they really do not have a place in an open source environment.

People often wonder how it is possible that a bug is open for a few years and still hasn't been fixed, despite Kubernetes being a very popular product.
Tim and Davanum answer this question by simply saying that there are only a few engineers who are 100% assigned to the Kubernetes project.
Engineers who are not assigned to the project try to contribute, but is often hard because of other commitments, whether those commitments are personal or business related.
As Kubernetes is globally adopted and used in a lot of international companies, there are a lot of issues coming in.
Sometimes, it's too much, and they simply don't have the time for it.
But as they say, the Kubernetes project is open source, anyone can create a pull request if people want to see a certain issue fixed.

They also want to highlight that, even though you have some frustrations with the product or things are not working as they are intended, you still have to remember that engineers are people aswell.
There is no place for rudeness, discourtesy and impoliteness.
You are allowed to express your frustrations, but do so in a kindly manner, without personally offending anyone.

Not every comment is a bad comment, and they want to show that, as they end the presentation with a series of thankful and heartwarming posts and comments about Kubernetes and the time and effort that is being committed in the Kubernetes project every single day.

# Noteworthy talks

- Norwegian public sector cloud: this talk provides a great insight into how the Norwegian public sector adopted Kubernetes and Cloud-native solutions to enhance their technology stack. 
- Cloud-Agnostic Approach to Bin-Packing pods in Managed Kubernetes in AWS, GCP and Azure: this talk provides some real-world optimizations that can be leveraged to improve the node utilization by making changes to the default scheduler in Kubernetes.
- We tested and compared 6 database operations: This talk shares (in a very funny pirate theme) the journey Enix made to select their preferred database Operators. TLDR; CNPG for PostgreSQL and the maria-operator for MariaDB.
- The party must go on - Resume pods after spot instance shut down: This talk gives an introduction and live demo of CRUI and CRIT which allows to essentially pause/hibernate containers to disk and restart them later without issue. This is a must-watch if you want to benefit from spot instances for batch workloads that don't support being paused of re-located half-way through their job.
