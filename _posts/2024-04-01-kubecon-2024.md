# Introduction

This year the cloud-native conference is hosted in the capital of love: Paris, France. 
The convention center, Expo Port de Versailles, is a huge complex. 
Funnily enough, it's so big that there are other (non-kubecon | cloudnativecon) events going on at the same time as Kubecon in the conference center. 
Pavillion 7 where the conference is hosted, is a very nice building which looks very recent. 
The biggest difference with the previous conferences we attended (Valencia and Amsterdam) is that everything is very close to each other. 
The building has 3 floors: the main entrance, the showcase floor and the talk-rooms-floor. 
All talks are held in rooms that are oriented in a large square, with the keynote room being in the middle. 
This makes it very easy to quickly switch between rooms, especially compared to the 5-10 minute walks we were used to in Valencia and Amsterdam.
